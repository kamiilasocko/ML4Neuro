Welcome to the repository for the material of the course Introduction of Machine learning for Neuroimaging
The course is managed by **Prof. A. Crimi, Dr. C. Koba, Dr. A. Onicas, and J. Falco-Roget**. 
You can find more contact information on https://bam.sano.science/

The goal of the course is to get familiar with neuroimaging data, and use machine learning to detect biomarkers for diseases.

The course alternate 1 week Lectures/Laboratories and 1 week Projects
There is no final exam. The grade is given by 50% on the handsout collected from the lab activities 2 weeks later, and final group project.
Each group project should be composed by 3-5 people. Multiple groups can choose the same project.

**Pre-requisites:**
Knowledge of Python, and basic Unix based system,
Undestanding of machine learning and deep learning concept

No knowledge of anatomy or physiology is required, but the willingness to learn basic concepts is expected.

**Learning material:**

**Lab plans**  
For Crimi's group: room 4.28 building D17

We alternate sessions of guided lab activities and assigned projects:
from October 3rd until January 23rd 2024 

1. Data structures, tools, and brain tumor segmentation
   
2. From tractography to connectoma (MRTRIX & DiPy), fiber clustering

3. Classify functional connectome via oldschool machine learning tools

4. Graph convolutional networks on functional connectome EEG

5. Effective connectivity with Granger Causality

6. LSD vs non-LSD group comparison, free assignment

Assignments are represented as report-like document in PDF (either from Word or TEX) with screenshot and few comments
of what you obtained from the notebooks.

**Projects** 

0. Proposed by the students

Crimi's project 

1. Natural scene reconstruction from EEG signals using generative latent diffusion
Inspired by fMRI paper (data and code available)
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42891-8
using the OpenBCI at our lab https://openbci.com/

2.  Structure-function coupling in stroke patients
Inspired by the healthy human connectome project (data and code available)
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920310946

3. Complex networks projects
You will be provided with final 3Dgraph, to do either graph convolutional networks or more complex networks theorertical projects
As https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811921005644
