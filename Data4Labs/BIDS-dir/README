Stroke_WUSM

Subjects with complete Structural and Diffusion MRI for a given session. The available sessions include ses-acute (1-2 weeks after stroke), ses-follow-up (3 months after ses-acute) and ses-followup-2 (12 months after ses-acute). The original list of subjects with DICOM has been filtered to only those subjects and sessions that complete 'anat' and 'dwi' nifti images. For the raw DICOM images please find the contact information below.

As of now (2022-04-26) all the sessions include the following:
- T1w MPRAGE anatomical scan (anat)
- single-shell HARDI diffusion-weighted MRI with 64 directions(dwi, acq-AP or acq-LR)

Useful information:
- Diffusion data are too big (>100MB) to be upload on the repository. Maybe they are pushed if they are resized into smaller voxel sizes (e.g., 2.5 mm3). Please reach out to ask the data if you wish.
